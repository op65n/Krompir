stone-cutter:
  # Damage value inflicted within a second
  # (Damage proc is every 5 ticks, thus the value being divided by 4)
  base-damage: 0.6
  # Exponential damage multiplier
  # (at first multiplies base damage, then the result of that multiplication,
  # to ramp up the damage value quicker)
  exponential-damage-gain-value: 1.3
